# 🏆 Sportsperson Image Classification Model

A machine learning project to classify sportspersons based on facial images using **Haar Cascades**, **image processing**, and **ML models** like **CNN**, **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, and **Decision Tree**. The model accurately identifies sportspersons such as Virat Kohli, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, and Mary Kom.

## 🖼️ Workflow

1. **Image Collection** – Downloaded labeled images of each sportsperson
2. **Face Detection** – Haar Cascade to detect faces & ensure eye detection
3. **Image Preprocessing** – Grayscale + Wavelet Transform
4. **Feature Extraction** – Flattened arrays for traditional models
5. **Model Training** – Trained multiple models and compared performance
6. **Evaluation** – Confusion Matrix + Accuracy comparison
